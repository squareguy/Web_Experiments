# Web_Experiments
Below are the details of all the experiments.

##id3
An app I created for helping me fix id3 tags.  
You upload a music file(s) and then it reads the filename and then opens the Wikipedia article of the corresponding song when you click the button.  
If you upload multiple files then it will open the Wikipedia article of the next song when you click the button.  
Your file is not sent to server, it stays in the browser, JS is used to read the filename.

##videoPlayer
I was experimenting with the HTML5 ```<video>``` tag.  
It lets you open a video (of supported format) from your hard drive or from a URL.

##Canvas Snake
Work in progress ```<canvas>``` snake game
